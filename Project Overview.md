# Waze â€“ User Churn Prediction Model Proposal

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting **user churn for the Waze navigation app**. By identifying users at high risk of churning, we aim to support **targeted retention strategies**, improve user experience, and drive business growth. The project follows the **PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute)** workflow and includes structured tasks and milestones.
