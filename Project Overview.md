# Waze â€“ User Churn Prediction Model Proposal

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting **user churn for the Waze navigation app**. By identifying users at high risk of churning, we aim to support **targeted retention strategies**, improve user experience, and drive business growth. The project follows the **PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute)** workflow and includes structured tasks and milestones.

## Project Results & Conclusion

### Key Findings

- **Churn Indicators Identified**:
  - **Low satisfaction levels** and **low engagement (fewer active days/month)** were the strongest predictors of churn.
  - **Users with fewer completed navigations**, **infrequent usage**, and **high report-to-trip ratios** also showed a higher churn tendency.
  - **No meaningful impact** was observed from age or city-specific features, suggesting churn is behavior-driven, not demographically driven.

- **Statistical Testing**:
  - Hypothesis tests confirmed a **statistically significant difference in satisfaction** and **average usage patterns** between churned and retained users.
  - Regression analysis demonstrated that satisfaction, average days active, and user engagement significantly influenced the churn probability.

- **Model Performance**:
  - The **logistic regression model** achieved moderate precision but struggled with recall due to class imbalance.
  - The **Random Forest model**, tuned with GridSearchCV, outperformed others, achieving:
    - **Accuracy**: ~82%
    - **F1 Score (Churn class)**: ~0.66
    - **ROC AUC**: ~0.84
  - Feature importance analysis confirmed the central role of **user activity frequency** and **satisfaction-related behaviors**.

### Final Deliverables

- A **machine learning model** capable of predicting high-risk churn users with strong ROC-AUC.
- A clear **set of behavioral churn drivers** that Waze can act on for retention marketing.

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that **user behavior and satisfaction are primary churn drivers** for Waze. By leveraging the final predictive model, the business can:
- **Flag high-risk users early**, enabling timely re-engagement campaigns.
- **Tailor the user experience** to reduce churn probability.
- **Inform product and UX enhancements** based on behavioral insights.

These insights equip Waze with data-driven strategies to **optimize retention** and sustain **long-term user engagement**.
